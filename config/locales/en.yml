      four privilege areas of ability, class, ethnicity, and gender correlate with your work experiences, primarily captured
      through your salary bracket. We plan to refine the model over time as more of you share your data. We do not store any
      personal information. We do keep a summary of the anonymised data, this can not be tracked back to you."
      optional: "All question sets and questions are optional. If you leave out a question, we will score it with the highest
      privilege."

      universities include Sciences Po in Paris (France), and EPFZ in Zurich (Switzerland). For other countries, think about
      the university and its international reputation, how often it appears in top 10 lists, and how difficult
      it is to gain entry, and choose whether you consider it elite or regular."
