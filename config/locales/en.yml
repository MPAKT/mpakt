      preamble: "There is no perfect model for privilege. We look at how your family background (parents, grandparents) in the
      four privilege areas of ability, class, ethnicity, and gender correlate with your work experiences, primarily captured
      through your salary bracket. We plan to refine the model over time as more of you share your data. We do not store any
      personal information. We do keep a summary of the anonymised data, this can not be tracked back to you."
      retired: "If you have stopped working or never worked, please answer based on your experiences for an adult period you
      remember well, including your health / abilities / gender / education status at the time."
      privacy: "Your privilege score is stored anonymously and securely. We do not share this information with any third party."
      optional: "All question sets and questions are optional. If you leave out a question, we will score it with the highest privilege."
