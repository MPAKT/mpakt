# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      We look at how your family background (parents, grandparents) in the four privilege areas of ability, class, race,
      and gender correlate with your salary now. We plan to refine the model over time as we get more information. We
      do not store any personal information. We do keep a summary of the anonymised data, which can not be tracked back to you."
      optional: "All question sets and questions are optional. We'll score with the highest privilege for and that you leave blank."
      retired: "If you are lucky enough to have retired, please answer these questions based on your experiences for the last job you
      remember well, including your health / ability status at the time."
