      safe: "DIPpy is a moderated safe space for anonymous conversations about diversity, inclusion, and privilege.
      It's built and moderated by volunteers, and we do not make any financial revenue from this site."
      welcome: "Please make everyone feel welcome here, even those with high privilege. Remember we may need their
       support to help us improve the world for us all."

      why: "Why did we build DIPpy? What will you find here?"
      safe_space: "Safe space"
      safe_space_1: "As members of several diversity groups on Facebook, we have seen posts that resonate with the group,
      who follow up with a lot of comments around 'me too' or 'how brave you are'. It seems that a lot of us are too scared
      to post our own stories in a forum like Facebook, where even closed or private groups may be read by government
      authorities or hackers, or there may be a friend-of-a-friend in the membership. Also, the facebook model of curated
      content and the page layouts don't lend themselves to deeper or threaded conversations."
      safe_space_2: "We have also seen some of these conversations look like they might kick off in slack.
      But this has the opposite challenge: a busy community has so much traffic that most of it scrolls
      out of sight before we can keep up with it, and the newish threading feature doesn't seem to provide a
      good solution."
      safe_space_3: "We believe there is a gap between Facebook and slack, for somewhere that is structured by forum
      and thread, as well as anonymised: this idea became DIPpy. Once we decided to allow anonymous content, there's a
      risk of abusive posts, which means we also need moderators."
      safe_space_4: "For all these reasons, we are building DIPpy with an anonymous, moderated forum where you can discuss diversity,
      inclusion, and privilege. The forum currently still work in progress, please have patience, we are a volunteer organisation."
      more_diversity: "More diversity"
      ability: "Ability"
      ability_1: "While not everything is fixed yet, it does feel as though there is a lot of discussion about gender and race
      privilege (and lack of) in both social and traditional media: at least the profile is raised and the discussions are
      happening. But there seems to be much less conversation about ability and class privileges. We wanted to capture data for
      all these communities and study just how much background affects careers."
      ability_2: "For ability privileges the lack of awareness and debate seems harsh, those who are not fully-abled have enough physical
      challenges without also facing prejudice, ability-ism, and invisibility. We thought we would encourage ability conversations, by way
       of support, and as a side effect, remind the rest of us how privileged we are if we don't need wheelchairs, screen readers, or
       extensive bed rest in order to navigate our lives."
      caste: "Class"
      caste_html: "Class privilege is currently floating almost completely under the radar, and we believe this should change. A lot of
      organisations have a bias towards an elite group, for example <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant'
      target='_blank'>WASPs</a> in America. If the conversation and data analytics only capture 'white males', this allows them to muddy
      the debate by appearing more diverse and less biased than they really are."
      caste_1: "Importantly, males who do not have class privilege get lumped into categories with privileged males and they
      resent it strongly, with some justification. Their university experiences, career options and salary expectations are likely
      to be very different from males and females who have both white and class privilege. And it seems to be members of the
       non-class-privileged male group who fuel populist votes that currently affect politics in so many countries. We thought we
       would try and support them here, as well as raise awareness."
      caste_2: "Defining class privilege is incredibly difficult in any country, and even more so on a global scale. The UK and
      India (as just two examples) have complex multi-layered class distinctions, and the US has a significant dose of denial."
      caste_3: "Rather than trying to define class directly, we have chosen a proxy instead. We ask you to identify whether or not you
      and both your parents went to university. If they did, we also ask you to distinguish between the various kinds of universities.
      It's not ideal, because some factors like age make a big difference. For example in the UK, around 5% of the population
      attended university in 1960, compared with nearly 40% in 2018. In spite of these limitations, we concluded that it would be the
      best compromise in capturing your parents' background without asking more intrusive questions or trying to differentiate
       between grains of sand."
      more_diversity_1: "For all these reasons, we built the anonymous privilege calculator, so that we could start to build
      a database of diversity, with primary focus on how it affects your working life. For the moment it has four key areas,
      equally weighted: the areas and weights may change in future as we collect data about privilege and its impact on your
      working life, so please do come back and check your privilege score again."
